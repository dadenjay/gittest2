<h4>Payment Options</h4>
<p>We currently accept the following payment options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paypal</li>
<li>Google Checkout</li>
<li>Major Credit Cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express).  See below.</li>
<li>Bank Account - with some banks, you can use your account and routing numbers to pay electronically through Paypal, using the same link shown below for credit card purchases.</li>

<li>Mail us a check &#8212; to Nathan Harrison, 1215 Andrea Drive, Chattanooga, TN 37419</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a Paypal or Google Checkout Account, and I don&#8217;t want to create one.  Can I check out with just a credit card?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes!  Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<p>Select Paypal as your choice of payment - even if you don&#8217;t have a Paypal account.</p>
<p>On the checkout page, you&#8217;ll have the option of bypassing logging in to a Paypal account.  Just click on the &#8220;Continue&#8221; link.  Then you&#8217;ll find the credit card information form.  The screen shot below shows the log-in bypass link.</p>
