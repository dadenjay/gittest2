<p>&#8220;I was so impressed and pleased with the drawer dividers we ordered for 3 kitchen drawers. Everything is PERFECT and so well organized. Bethany was so great to work with - she has great knowledge of exactly what you need and some other things I had not thought of that I love. They fit beautifully and with extra dividers, I could really customize each drawer. Total perfection! Thank you so very much!!!&#8221; - Patricia C., Charleston, SC - 2/14/12</p>

<p>&#8220;We received the drawer insert a couple of weeks ago and we  absolutely love it! It fits perfectly in our drawer and it has really  optimized the usable space in the drawer that we&#8217;ve desperately needed since we got our new flatware. If I ever need another customized drawer insert, I will be sure to reach out to you!&#8221; - Megan C., Baltimore, MD, 2-8-2012</p>
<p>&#8220;I received the insert and it fits perfectly.  The craftsmanship is  great quality.  I plan to order a couple more drawers in the next week  or so.  I just need to decide how I want them organized.&#8221; - Dylan R., Washington, DC, 1-31-12</p>
    <p>&#8220;My drawer organizer arrived today and, for the first time since we  remodeled our kitchen 10 years ago, I have all my spices organized.  The  organizer fit the drawer perfectly and the quality is excellent.  The  movable dividers allowed me the flexibility to accommodate all the  various jar sizes.</p>
    <p>I&#8217;m very pleased and I&#8217;m  thinking about what other other drawers I might want to organize.   Thanks so much for your help in designing the organizer; you made it  easy.</p>
    <p>I have only one regret - that I didn&#8217;t discover Orderly Drawer 10 years ago!&#8221; - Patricia S., Yardley, PA, 1-31-12</p>

    <p>&#8220;My custom insert arrived last week and I just wanted to let you know how  happy I am with it. It fit perfectly with no extra space for it to  slide around and works great. It is so nice to open the drawer and see  the nice hardwood insert holding my flatware instead of the bright  yellow plastic tray that has been sliding around in there for the last  20 years.&#8221; - James F., Chandler, AZ, 1-27-12</p>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wanted to tell you that I absolutely love the organizer!! It  came today and it fits perfectly.  I am so excited to finally have order  in that huge drawer- I wish I had known about you all 6 years ago when  we bought the house!  I took a before and after picture and am going to  post it on my facebook with your link, maybe you will snag a few more  customers. <img style="font-size: 10pt; border-style: none; vertical-align: text-bottom;" title="Open-mouth smile" alt="Open-mouth smile" width="19" height="19" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> I have no doubt that I will be contacting you again soon.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!!!!&#8221;p - Martha C., Lutz, FL, 1-18-2012</p>
<p>&#8220;AMAZING!!  We got it and looks/works amazingly well, thank you!!!  We will most probably be back for some more drawer organizers. Thanks again and happy new year!&#8221; - Mauricio D., New York, NY, 12-31-11</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very very happy with the insert.<br />
    It fits *perfectly*, and the interior dimensions are exactly right.<br />
    The craftsmanship and materials are superb.<br />
    Thank you very much for the attention to high quality. I am highly impressed.&#8221; - John R., Palm Springs, CA, 12-21-11</p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #1f497d;">&#8220;I  LOVED the drawer inserts!!! Thank you so much, they are amazing!!! I am  going to be moving to a new house in  the next six months and I will  definitely be calling you to do my new kitchen. Thank you again! I am SO  happy!!&#8221; - Kristine P, Chicago 11-29-11<br />

<p><em>&#8220;I have searched for years for a new flatware holder for an odd sized  long and narrow drawer, without luck.After viewing the Orderly Drawer  templates I choose to modify one. I am very pleased with the organizer,  it fit perfectly and I received it in a timely manner. The only thing I  would have not ordered was the non slip mat. I thought the mat would be  built inside the organizer, but apparently it is sold to go underneath  orgainziers without a bottom. Since I ordered the insert with a bottom,  it was not needed. I love the ability to move the slots around to fit my  items and I am very satisfied with this product.&#8221;</em> - Laurie W., Livonia, MI, 11-20-2011</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The inserts arrived, fit beautifully, and work perfectly.  My kitchen designer is going to be very impressed&#8230;I have really enjoyed the efficient and friendly dealings I have had  with you.  Orderly Drawer is an exceptional company offering an  exceptional product.</em><em>&#8220;</em> - William W., Santa Fe, NM, August 7, 2011</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Just to let you know that the drawer organizer  arrived and is already installed – it looks great and has brought sanity  to a very disorganized drawer (and me!).  Thanks again,&#8221;</em> - William C., June 15, 2011</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Yesterday, we received our drawer inserts.  WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!  (Please excuse my uncharacteristic gushing).  They look better and work better than we imagined from your website.  The fit is exact.  The movable dividers are an excellent feature, and that feature is what really sold me on your product in the first place.  We will definitely spread the word amongst our friends and everyone else we can.  Good luck with your business.  May you thrive a long time.&#8221;</em> - Nick H, Vancouver, WA</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>&#8220;I have my custom drawers in place&#8230;and I LOVE them!!!!<br />
    I have enclosed a photo&#8230;just because&#8230;<br />

    But here is the real win:  my husband is a well-known architect in New  York City.  When we renovated our new home, we did not have time to  include drawings for the kitchen drawer inserts.  When I shared with him  that I was ordering them online, he was very skeptical.  But, to make a  long story short, he asked me to order more.  So I am going to place an  order for 4 more drawers – just have to start planning.&#8221;</em> - Betty S., New York, NY</span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Fabulous! Excellent! Wonderful! Need I say more???? I Love it!!!!!&#8221;</em> - Beverly M., Boone, CO</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We received the drawer insert yesterday. Thanks it is perfect for what we wanted it for. It fits the drawer like a glove, great workmanship. We will use your company again. Thanks again.&#8221;</em> - Bill P., Elma, NY</p>
<p><em>Arrived safely and fits perfectly!!  &#8230;you obviously know what you are doing&#8230;Really a very good product.  Thank you.</em> - Susan F., Park City, UT</p>

<p><em>I just unpacked my organizer and it&#8217;s absolutely perfect! My tiny drawer now holds all our flatware and the shorter back row is perfect for baby spoons and cheese spreaders and extra mismatched utensils.<br />
    I&#8217;m really happy I found your website&#8230; it&#8217;s such a nice custom made storage solution and less expensive even than some of the plastic junk they sell in the big box home stores. It&#8217;s been a pleasure working with you and I will definitely recommend orderly drawer to my friends.<br />
</em> - Rebecca C., New York, NY</p>
<p><em>&#8220;My drawer organizer came today, thank you for shipping so quickly. I had to write you and let you know how pleased I am. It fits just perfectly and now I can actually see what I&#8217;m grabbing for. Having the removable dividers to customize each section really makes it ideal&#8230;In fact, I&#8217;m so pleased I&#8217;m going to order 2 more organizers for my cooking utensil drawers.&#8221; - </em>Joslyn H., South Elgin, IL</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>I just wanted to thank you both for my Drawer organizer. It fits perfectly and I love it&#8230;</strong><strong>This worked out perfectly for me. My little condo only had 8  inch drawers in the kitchen and I could not find anything in stores.  They either had 3 inch individual holders or 9 inch holders.&#8221; - Frank R., Asbury Park, NJ - 2-6-2012<br />

<p><em>&#8220;My drawer dividers arrived today and they are perfect&#8230; everything was fantastic.  Just wanted to say thanks for the  fast shipping, for shipping to an APO and for the install instructions.   Using them for an antique dresser.  Tried spring loaded ones before but  the drawer backs were too weak for it.  These are exactly what I was  looking for.  Thanks again!&#8221;</em> - Sarah L., June 1, 2011</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Excellent service, easy to install for drawers with unusual height, &amp; durable.&#8221;</em> - Judith T., Mt. Pleasant, SC</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I love my expandable drawer dividers, I like that they stayed in place. I got 14. Now my drawers are organized and pretty. Very good choice and price.&#8221;</em> - Carla F., Oak Creek, WI</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I love my Cimple drawer dividers! I fully admit that I have too much stuff, but &#8230; I have always tried to keep my shirts organized by color. I keep my whites/creams in one drawer, grays/blacks in another, brights in another, and so on. Smart but still problematic, I would have to dig through the entire drawer trying to find the T or tank I wanted. I have installed the Cimple drawer dividers all by myself I will add (totally EASY)&#8230;I can easily find the the exact turquiose tanks I want for layering and not destroy my room! I&#8217;ve also put a divider in my underwear drawer&#8230; My bra drawer has never looked this good.  Again, I love my Cimple drawer dividers!&#8221;</em> - Heather W., Jefferson, IN</p>

<p><em>&#8220;THANK YOU!Fast shipping!These are WONDERFUL, easy to put together and look GREAT!&#8221;</em> - Monique C., Waukegan, IL</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Hard to find deep dividers. Very well made compared to rest. Thanks.&#8221;</em> - Brandy C, Miramar, FL</p>
<p><em>&#8220;A bit tricky, but much more affordable than the spring-loaded dividers. Thanks!&#8221; </em>- Kathleen M, Chardon, OH</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The following is from a customer who purchased and returned some Cimple Drawer Dividers:</strong><br />
    <em>&#8220;There were too many pieces to each divider.  I am a very senior citizen.  I wanted and prefer the spring system which seems to work much more easily and is only one piece.  I think that if you would/could reduce the piece amount on your system, they might work better.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Our response:</strong><br />

    For now, we&#8217;ve decided to stick with our current design even though our Cimple Drawer dividers are difficult for some people to install.  Here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li> since it is not dependent on moving parts (like a spring), the divider is very durable, and we&#8217;re able to offer a lifetime guarantee</li>
    <li>with no metal parts, we&#8217;re able to offer a great product at a great price</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">we make the tallest dividers on the market.  The spring technology can only work with small and medium heights.  As far as we know, our 6&#8243; Cimple is the tallest non-custom drawer divider on the market.  And we&#8217;re considering offering even taller ones.</li>
