<p><em>&#8220;The inserts arrived, fit beautifully, and work perfectly.  My kitchen designer is going to be very impressed&#8230;I have really enjoyed the efficient and friendly dealings I have had  with you.  Orderly Drawer is an exceptional company offering an  exceptional product.</em><em>&#8220;</em> - William W., Santa Fe, NM, August 7, 2011</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Just to let you know that the drawer organizer  arrived and is already installed – it looks great and has brought sanity  to a very disorganized drawer (and me!).  Thanks again,&#8221;</em> - William C., June 15, 2011</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Yesterday, we received our drawer inserts.  WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!  (Please excuse my uncharacteristic gushing).  They look better and work better than we imagined from your website.  The fit is exact.  The movable dividers are an excellent feature, and that feature is what really sold me on your product in the first place.  We will definitely spread the word amongst our friends and everyone else we can.  Good luck with your business.  May you thrive a long time.&#8221;</em> - Nick H, Vancouver, WA</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>&#8220;I have my custom drawers in place&#8230;and I LOVE them!!!!<br />
I have enclosed a photo&#8230;just because&#8230;<br />
But here is the real win:  my husband is a well-known architect in New  York City.  When we renovated our new home, we did not have time to  include drawings for the kitchen drawer inserts.  When I shared with him  that I was ordering them online, he was very skeptical.  But, to make a  long story short, he asked me to order more.  So I am going to place an  order for 4 more drawers – just have to start planning.&#8221;</em> - Betty S., New York, NY</span></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Fabulous! Excellent! Wonderful! Need I say more???? I Love it!!!!!&#8221;</em> - Beverly M., Boone, CO</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We received the drawer insert yesterday. Thanks it is perfect for what we wanted it for. It fits the drawer like a glove, great workmanship. We will use your company again. Thanks again.&#8221;</em> - Bill P., Elma, NY</p>
<p><em>Arrived safely and fits perfectly!!  &#8230;you obviously know what you are doing&#8230;Really a very good product.  Thank you.</em> - Susan F., Park City, UT</p>
<p><em>I just unpacked my organizer and it&#8217;s absolutely perfect! My tiny drawer now holds all our flatware and the shorter back row is perfect for baby spoons and cheese spreaders and extra mismatched utensils.<br />

I&#8217;m really happy I found your website&#8230; it&#8217;s such a nice custom made storage solution and less expensive even than some of the plastic junk they sell in the big box home stores. It&#8217;s been a pleasure working with you and I will definitely recommend orderly drawer to my friends.<br />
</em> - Rebecca C., New York, NY</p>
<p><em>&#8220;My drawer organizer came today, thank you for shipping so quickly. I had to write you and let you know how pleased I am. It fits just perfectly and now I can actually see what I&#8217;m grabbing for. Having the removable dividers to customize each section really makes it ideal&#8230;In fact, I&#8217;m so pleased I&#8217;m going to order 2 more organizers for my cooking utensil drawers.&#8221; - </em>Joslyn H., South Elgin, IL</p>

<p><em>&#8220;My drawer dividers arrived today and they are perfect&#8230; everything was fantastic.  Just wanted to say thanks for the  fast shipping, for shipping to an APO and for the install instructions.   Using them for an antique dresser.  Tried spring loaded ones before but  the drawer backs were too weak for it.  These are exactly what I was  looking for.  Thanks again!&#8221;</em> - Sarah L., June 1, 2011</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Excellent service, easy to install for drawers with unusual height, &amp; durable.&#8221;</em> - Judith T., Mt. Pleasant, SC</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I love my expandable drawer dividers, I like that they stayed in place. I got 14. Now my drawers are organized and pretty. Very good choice and price.&#8221;</em> - Carla F., Oak Creek, WI</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I love my Cimple drawer dividers! I fully admit that I have too much stuff, but &#8230; I have always tried to keep my shirts organized by color. I keep my whites/creams in one drawer, grays/blacks in another, brights in another, and so on. Smart but still problematic, I would have to dig through the entire drawer trying to find the T or tank I wanted. I have installed the Cimple drawer dividers all by myself I will add (totally EASY)&#8230;I can easily find the the exact turquiose tanks I want for layering and not destroy my room! I&#8217;ve also put a divider in my underwear drawer&#8230; My bra drawer has never looked this good.  Again, I love my Cimple drawer dividers!&#8221;</em> - Heather W., Jefferson, IN</p>
<p><em>&#8220;THANK YOU!Fast shipping!These are WONDERFUL, easy to put together and look GREAT!&#8221;</em> - Monique C., Waukegan, IL</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Hard to find deep dividers. Very well made compared to rest. Thanks.&#8221;</em> - Brandy C, Miramar, FL</p>

<p><em>&#8220;A bit tricky, but much more affordable than the spring-loaded dividers. Thanks!&#8221; </em>- Kathleen M, Chardon, OH</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The following is from a customer who purchased and returned some Cimple Drawer Dividers:</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;There were too many pieces to each divider.  I am a very senior citizen.  I wanted and prefer the spring system which seems to work much more easily and is only one piece.  I think that if you would/could reduce the piece amount on your system, they might work better.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Our response:</strong><br />
For now, we&#8217;ve decided to stick with our current design even though our Cimple Drawer dividers are difficult for some people to install.  Here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li> since it is not dependent on moving parts (like a spring), the divider is very durable, and we&#8217;re able to offer a lifetime guarantee</li>

<li>with no metal parts, we&#8217;re able to offer a great product at a great price</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">we make the tallest dividers on the market.  The spring technology can only work with small and medium heights.  As far as we know, our 6&#8243; Cimple is the tallest non-custom drawer divider on the market.  And we&#8217;re considering offering even taller ones.</li>
</ul>
