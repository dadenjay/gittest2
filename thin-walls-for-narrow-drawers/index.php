<title>Orderly Drawer Organizers - Thin Walls for Narrow Drawers </title>

<h1>Thin Side Walls for Narrow Drawers</h1>
<p>We&#8217;ll use the thinnest wood available that will be structurally sound for your drawer insert.  We do this in an effort to maximize the usable space you&#8217;ll have available in your drawer.  We can use thin side walls with only some of our templates.  They are templates #2, 16, 17, 18, and 6.</p>
<p>Thin walls are especially important for narrow drawers.  We&#8217;ve used thin side walls (like in the photo below) for many customers with narrow drawers, and they&#8217;ve all been pleased.</p>
