<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="right"><a href="http://orderlydrawer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/njh-headshot.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-682" title="nathan harrison" src="http://orderlydrawer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/njh-headshot-245x243.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="243" /></a></div>
<p>OrderlyDrawer.com is owned and operated by Nathan and Bethany Harrison in Chattanooga, TN.  Nathan&#8217;s wood-working experience began when he apprenticed under an elderly cabinet maker in west Alabama, beginning in 2000.  After moving to Chattanooga, his skills continued to progress, and he is now known by some long-established kitchen and bath designers as the best cabinet/woodwork installer in the greater Chattanooga area.</p>
<p>In addition to installing cabinetry for other kitchen designers, he also designs and builds custom projects.  It was a custom kitchen that led him to develop OrderlyDrawer.com.</p>
<p>A client wanted a special custom drawer organizer built for their kitchen.  They had seen what they wanted in one of the big box stores, but the store only had the organizer in a few sizes.  To get a custom fit, Nathan built the client one of these organizers for a perfect fit.  It looked wonderful, and the client was pleased.</p>
<p>About a month later, when Nathan followed up with the client to make sure everything was still satisfactory, he was surprised to find him less than happy.  The configuration of the compartments (designed by a leading cabinet manufacturer and sold by a leading home warehouse as their &#8220;top of the line&#8221; product) was not laid out well.  And all compartments were the same width - too much room for many utensils, but not enough for others.  He was told, &#8220;If you could find some way to make this thing adjustable, that would be great.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, to the drawing board and the shop he went.  The (very adjustable) Orderly Drawer was born.</p>
<p>Orderly Drawers are made from raw lumber in our shop.  We do all steps ourselves: sizing, cutting, sanding, finishing, assembling, packing and shipping.  If anything goes wrong, the buck stops here.  We&#8217;re a one-stop shop for your orders, suggestions, compliments, and complaints.  That&#8217;s why we gladly stand by <a href="/policies" target="_self">our guarantee to our customers</a>.</p>
