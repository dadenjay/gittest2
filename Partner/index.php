<p>Relationships take time to build and good relationships are very valuable.</p>
<p>We reward people whose hard-earned relationships can help us find more happy customers for our OrderlyDrawer.com products.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here&#8217;s how it works:</span></p>
<p>When you refer a buyer to our website and a purchase is made, you&#8217;ll earn a 10% commission on their purchases.</p>
<p>When a visitor is referred from you, our shopping cart and affiliate manager sets a cookie in the buyer&#8217;s browser that expires in 6 months. You, the affiliate partner, will earn a 10% commission on every product the buyer purchases during the lifetime of that cookie.</p>

<p>Payments to affiliate partners will be made once a month.  Payments for commissions made in January will be paid out in February, etc.  Payments will be made through Paypal, so you&#8217;ll need to have a Paypal account.</p>
