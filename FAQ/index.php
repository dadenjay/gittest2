<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>What wood do you use?</em></span></strong><br />
For our Custom products, we use maple.  For our Cimple drawer dividers, we use unfinished plywood.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>I&#8217;m planning to order a custom, but it seems like you need to have more measurements from me than what you ask on the order form.  Don&#8217;t you need measurements for each section?</strong></em></span><br /> The measurements we have you specify for the templates on our site - your drawer width, depth, and the A,B,C &amp; D values (if applicable for your template) - are the only measurements we need.  All other measurements will be determined by the ones you give us.</p>

<p><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>How many movable dividers will I get in my custom drawer insert?</em></strong></span><br />  You can decide.  Using our order forms, you can increase or decrease the suggest number of movable dividers.  Your price will adjust accordingly.  We cannot provide movable dividers for compartments that are less than 3&#8243; wide.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>What is the spacing increment between the slots on your custom insert?</strong></em></span><br /><a href="/slot-spacing">  See details of our slot spacing here.</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;"><em><strong>Why would someone want a bottomless custom insert?</strong> </em></span><br /> In most - <a href="/attached-bottom">but not all cases</a> - an attached bottom is unnecessary since the drawer bottom can serve as the organizer bottom.  Also, some believe that drawers are easier to clean when the organizer is bottomless.  The insert can be lifted out so that the drawer can be wiped clean.  This way there will be no buildup of debris in the corners of your organizer.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>Why does adding a bottom to my organizer raise the price so much? </em></span> </strong><br />There are 3 reasons.  One: it requires more wood.  Two: The process of adding a bottom to these inserts is kind of tricky; extra care is needed.  Three: When we add a bottom, the shipping weight - and therefore, the shipping price - goes up.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>How accurately are you able to make custom inserts?  If I want an 8.5" wide insert, will the end product be exactly 8.5"?</em></span></strong><br />  Ideally, yes.  We consider our work unsatisfactory if the insert's actual dimensions are not within +/- 1/16 inch (or 0.06 inch) of your requested dimensions.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #800000;">When will I receive my order?</span></em><em> </em></strong><br />We can ship non-custom items within a couple of days.  For custom items, we'll ship within 12 business days.  </p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>Do you ship outside the continental US?</em></span></strong><br />  To give a quote, we'll  need to know the shipping location, the drawer dimensions of any custom inserts you are planning to buy, and if you'll be adding a bottom to your organizer.</p>

<p><strong><em><span style="color: #800000;">Are your products sold in stores?</span></em></strong><br /> Some non-custom items are available through Amazon.com.</p>
