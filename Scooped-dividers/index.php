<title>Orderly Drawer Organizers - Scooped Dividers</title>

<h4>Scooped Dividers</h4>
<p>For 2.5&#8243;+ tall organizers, depending on what you&#8217;re planning to store in them and how wide your compartments will be, you may benefit from scooped dividers.  This makes items in tall, narrow    compartments more accessible.  The hand has room to more comfortably reach into a tall, narrow compartment.  The charge for scoops is $3 per movable    divider.  We can make a scoop in any divider that is 5&#8243; or more in length.</p>

<p>Scoops are recommended for 3&#8243; (or taller) tall dividers.  We can scoop dividers in inserts that are 2.5&#8243; or taller and that are at least 5&#8243; in length.</p>

<p>Please indicate the number of scooped dividers you require using the &#8220;notes&#8221; field on our <a href="http://orderlydrawer.com/the-custom">custom insert</a> ordering form.  For example: &#8220;Please include two scooped dividers in area A (where the dimension &#8220;A&#8221; is located) and three in the top left section.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can also request that we scoop every other divider.</p>
