<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I love my Cimple drawer dividers!&#8230;I have installed the Cimple drawer dividers all by myself I will add (totally EASY)&#8230;Again, I love my Cimple drawer dividers! - Heather W.</em></p>
<p>We call it &#8220;Cimple&#8221; because it&#8217;s REALLY SIMPLE.  (and all our other products start with a &#8220;C&#8221;)<a href="http://orderlydrawer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc076001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-909" title="expandable drawer divider" src="http://orderlydrawer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc076001-245x183.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="183" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Our Cimple Expandable Wood Drawer Divider will work for distances from 12&#8243; up to 17&#8243;.  The 6&#8243; high dividers are also available in XL (extra-long) size, fitting distances from 17-24&#8243;.</p>

<p>The Cimple Divider uses solid-wood, adhesive-backed feet to grip the walls of your drawer.  (The non-permanent adhesive tape can be moved multiple times and will not leave a residue on your drawers.)  Then, the expandable cabinet-grade plywood walls slide out to fit into the cushioned groove in the wooden feet.  Finally, we provide a quality styrene cap to lock the divider in place and to offer a smooth top edge that&#8217;s easy on your delicate items.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Plastic Drawer Dividers?</strong></p>
<p>Who really wants plastic in their home when they can have quality woodwork <em>for less? </em>One of the biggest complaints with plastic dividers is their short lifespan.  Another is that there&#8217;s no way to create outward pressure so that the divider stays in place.   Other plastic organizers on the market are just plain flimsy, though it&#8217;s hard to tell from the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>What about Spring Loaded Dividers?</strong></p>
<p>The shortcomings of spring-based expandable dividers are the risk of breaking the drawer and the overall cost of the dividers.  The spring-loaded system requires significant pressure to stay in place.  This excessive pressure can damage drawers, even to the point of drawer fronts coming loose.  <em>This is why our product is designed to allow you to control the pressure in the divider.</em> Don&#8217;t risk your home&#8217;s woodwork!</p>

<p>Spring-tension dividers also have the problem of variability over their spring ranges.  This means that the divider will be under great tension when fully compressed, but when it needs to expand out to the limits of its reach, the tension may not be enough to hold it in place!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll compare the cost of our dividers with those including spring systems, you&#8217;ll see that the spring mechanism adds a lot to the total cost.</p>
<p>It is true that our dividers take a little longer to set and adjust than the spring-loaded ones.  But we&#8217;re confident that you&#8217;ll appreciate the lower cost and easy-on-your-drawers nature of our dividers.</p>

<p><strong>Doubles as a Shelf Divider!</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right.  You can use the Cimple to divide shelves from 17&#8243; high opening all the way down to around 7&#8243;.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons You Might Not Want to Choose the Cimple</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cimple is made of natural wood, sanded smooth so it is easy on your delicates and fingers.  <em>However, you may find that it is not smooth enough for repeated contact with ultra-delicate items such as hosiery.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Cimple derives its amazing affordability from a unique design that requires moderate hand strength to install.  (Don&#8217;t be intimidated, though.  If our nine-year-old daughter can&#8217;t install it, we send it back to the shop.)  Those with arthritis or very weak hands may need to have assistance for installation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>When installed properly, the Cimple will be sturdy and stout.  However, it is not designed for heavy duty applications - like separating pots and pans.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Cimple 2nds - Available while supplies last</h2>
<p>When making our Cimple dividers, we often end up with some pieces of wood that don&#8217;t pass muster.  They might have blemishes or be slightly warped.  Some are worse than others.  But they are all functional.  If you&#8217;re in need of some drawer dividers on the cheap, you&#8217;ve found them.  These won&#8217;t look pretty (though many aren&#8217;t that bad), but they&#8217;ll get the job of dividing a drawer done for you.  Availability of these items will fluctuate.</p>
